	<h1>Sequana: a set of NGS pipelines</h1>
	<p>This page serves as an additional set of resources for
		the Sequana project. Sequana is comprised of a Python library, the 
        documentation of which is accessible on <a href="http://sequana.readthedocs.org">Read The Docs</a>.
        The source code for the Python library can be found on 
		<a href="http://github.com/sequana/sequana">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>One of the primary objective of the Sequana project is to offer a collection of NGS pipelines.
    The pipelines currently available are located on PyPI and the <a
      href="https://github.com/sequana/sequana">Sequana GitHub organisation page</a>,
   each having their own repository. For instance, the RNA-seq pipeline can be found at <a href="https://github.com/sequana/rnaseq">sequana/rnaseq</a>.

    This page is also a place for providing supplementary information to the main repositories.

    The following was generated with the Sequana Coverage standalone application and keep here a it is reference in other places. This is the coverage along a virus genome where the black dot line represent the coverage, the blue is the median coverage, and red lines are the top and bottow thresholds for detecting event of interest.
