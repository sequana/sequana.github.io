	<h1>Sequana: a set of NGS pipelines</h1>
	<p>This page is used as an additional set of resources for
		the Sequana project. Sequana is made of a Python library whose 
        documentation is available on <a href="http://sequana.readthedocs.org">readthedocs</a>.
        Source code of the Python library is available on 
		<a href="http://github.com/sequana/sequana">github</a>.</p>

    <p>One of the main purpose of the Sequana project is to provide a set of NGS pipelines.
    Pipelines currently available are on pypi and <a
      href="https://github.com/sequana/sequana">sequana github organisation page</a>. They have their own repository.
For example the RNA-seq pipeline is available on <a href="https://github.com/sequana/rnaseq">sequana/rnaseq</a>.

    This page is also a place to provide complementary information to the main repositories.
